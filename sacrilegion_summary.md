## SacRilegion Brand Guidelines Summary

*   **Brand Name:** SacRilegion (Holy Rebellion Execution Bible)
*   **Core Concept:** Fusing theological discourse with street culture through apparel. "Prophet-meets-punk" voice guide (e.g., "Repent? Nah. Rebuild.").
*   **Brand Assets:**
    *   **Logo:** Gothic cathedral spire piercing a broken skateboard (vector file + B&W variant).
    *   **Color Palette:** `#1a1a1a` (Void Black), `#8c1c13` (Sacrificial Red), `#d4af37` (Divine Gold).
*   **Product Examples:** Glitch Eucharist Tee (pixelated "Body of Christ" graffiti), Inverted Cross Keychain (cast in recycled bullet casings), Psalm 23 Trap Lyrics Hoodie (AI-remixed scripture audio QR code).
*   **Controversy Engineering:** Sacred-Profane Product Matrix (e.g., "Turn the other cheek" -> "...but keep hands up" boxing hand wraps; Judas Iscariot -> social media influencer phone grip with betrayal counter; Levitical purity laws -> "Unholy Water" mineral spray skate deck cleaner).
*   **Crisis Response Protocol:** Tiered response to backlash, including deploying debate bots, releasing "Reformation Drop," and activating "Repentance Protocol" (donating profits, "Sacred & Profane" collab, Baptism NFT airdrops).
*   **AI Integration:** Extensive use of AI for design (Midjourney API + Religious Art LoRA), brand monitoring (HereticAI for controversy/sentiment), and marketing (ProfitProphet for ROAS optimization).
*   **Launch Sequence:** Focused on securing handles, generating concepts, creating theological debate bait (TikTok), targeted FB ads, and a "Sinners Sanctuary" Discord.
*   **Key Weapons:** Midjourney Sacred LoRA (trained on Dürer etchings × Basquiat tags), HereticAI Command Center (real-time backlash velocity dashboard), Baptism Authentication App (AR "holy water" sprinkle -> NFT unlock), Repentance Protocol Switches (3-tier crisis kill system).
*   **Overall Tone:** "This isn't fashion. It's theological warfare in cotton and code. Your first drop must hit like a desecrated sacrament."
